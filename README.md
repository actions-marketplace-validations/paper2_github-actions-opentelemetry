This action sends metrics and traces of GitHub Actions to an OpenTelemetry
endpoint (OTLP). It helps you monitor and analyze GitHub Actions.

## Features Summary

- üìä Collects Metrics of GitHub Actions workflows and job execution times
- üîç Collects Traces of GitHub Actions workflow, jobs, steps.
- üì¶ Sends data to any OTLP-compatible backend for monitoring and observability
- üöÄ Easy integration with GitHub workflows

## Limitations

- OTLP authentication is not supported yet.
- Metric and attribute names may undergo breaking changes due to the
  experimental status.

## Metrics

| Descriptor Name               | Description          |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `cicd.pipeline.duration`      | Duration of workflow |
| `cicd.pipeline.task.duration` | Duration of job      |

Each metric has associated attributes.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create OTLP Endpoint**: Set up an OTLP backend to receive telemetry data
   (e.g., Jaeger, Prometheus, or other monitoring tools).
1. **Add a Workflow**: Create a new workflow file and use this action triggered
   by
   [workflow_run](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_run)
   because this action collects telemetry of completed workflows.

### GitHub Actions Example

Here's an example of how to set up this action in a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Send Telemetry after Other Workflow

on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows:
      - Check Transpiled JavaScript
      - Continuous Integration
      - CodeQL
      - Lint Codebase
    types:
      - completed

permissions:
  # Required for private repositories
  actions: read

jobs:
  send-telemetry:
    name: Send CI Telemetry
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run
        id: run
        uses: paper2/github-actions-opentelemetry@v0.0.7
        env:
          OTEL_SERVICE_NAME: github-actions-opentelemetry
          OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT: https://collector-example.com
          FEATURE_TRACE: true
        with:
          # Required for collecting workflow data
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Configuration

To configure the action, you need to set the following environment variables:

| Environment Variable                  | Required | Default Value | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`                   | Yes      | -             | Service name.                                                             |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`         | No       | -             | OTLP Endpoint for Traces and Metrics. e.g., https://collector-example.com |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT` | No       | -             | OTLP Endpoint for Metrics instead of OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT.         |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT`  | No       | -             | OTLP Endpoint for Traces instead of OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT.          |
| `FEATURE_TRACE`                       | No       | `false`       | Enable trace feature.                                                     |
| `OTEL_LOG_LEVEL`                      | No       | `info`        | Log level.                                                                |
